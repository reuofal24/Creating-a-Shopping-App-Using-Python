# Creating-a-Shopping-App-Using-Python
## Python Project - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence T5

### As part of one of these projects, we had an important project titled "Creating a Shopping App Using Python" This project focused on developing an e-commerce application with features such as login and account registration on the Python platform. The goal of the app was to provide users with a smooth and secure shopping experience. The app was designed to include multiple categories, such as shoes, clothing, and electronics, allowing users to browse and purchase products easily according to their preferred categories.

### We implemented the programming guidelines using Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
The project involved writing specific code to create an effective user interface and provide various functionalities such as adding products to the cart. 

### Additionally, we documented the concept along with the guidelines in a separate file from the code solution to clarify the steps followed and to provide a detailed explanation of each part of the app, making it easier for others to understand and replicate the project.
